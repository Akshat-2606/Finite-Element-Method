# Finite-Element-Method
This Repository is based on the Simulation model of 2 Structural models.Firstly, it consists of the 1D h-p code for a slender bar which involves giving the inputs in the form of number of steps to be used along with the order of the Approximating functions. Secondly, it consists of simulation of a Euler Beam Bending Problem.
